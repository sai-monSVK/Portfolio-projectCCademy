Hello.

It's me --Simeon.


You know me right? NO? What are you doing here than? 

Brief About Me
I'm a novice Full Stack Engineer located in Slovakia. At the moment, I'm completing a course on web development on the CodeCademy website - and in fact, this website is part of it. So don't take this very seriously, but I hope you like it at least a little. What more? Everything -- 42 --.
